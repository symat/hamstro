# Hamstro

Hamstro is a small handheld hobby computer based on an 8 bit AVR microcontroller. It is a small gameboy, which can be connected to a docking station which enables extended functionalities transforming the Hamstro board to a full, standalone computer.



The main language of the project is Esperanto (just for my sae, to learn and practice the lanuage).
